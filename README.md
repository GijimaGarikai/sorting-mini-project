# Sorting Mini-Project

## Author
**Garikai Gijima**

## Project Description
This repository contains various sorting algorithm implementations along with tests to verify their correctness and efficiency. The main focus is on classical sorting techniques such as Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and a simplified version of TimSort.

### Features
- **Implementation of Sorting Algorithms**: Each sorting algorithm is implemented with clear, concise code and comments to explain the logic.
- **Testing Framework**: Tests are included to ensure each sorting algorithm works as expected and to compare their performance on different datasets.

### Sorting Algorithms Implemented
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Simplified TimSort

## Acknowledgments
- All implementations besides TimSort were based on my previous project on [sorting algorithm visualizations in Python](https://github.com/GijimaGarikai/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser)
- ChatGPT helped to design and implement the simplified TimSort algorithm. ChatGPT is good at providing explanations, answering common questions, and troubleshooting syntax or standard algorithm implementations. Complex problems like a simplified version of timSort need you to guide it through interactive discussions and step-by-step development. Overall I had a good experience with it and learned a lot about timSort (maybe I'll add it to my python project?)
